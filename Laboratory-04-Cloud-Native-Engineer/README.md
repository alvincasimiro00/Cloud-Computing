 Laboratory 04 — Cloud-Native Engineer

 Mission Overview

This laboratory activity focuses on understanding the shift from traditional virtualization to containerization. The goal is to compare Virtual Machines and Containers, verify Docker environment status, deploy a containerized Nginx web server, and manage the full lifecycle of a container using Docker commands.

 Objectives

- Differentiate traditional Virtual Machines from Containers
- Verify Docker installation and environment status
- Execute basic Docker commands to pull and run images
- Deploy and access a containerized web application
- Manage container lifecycle: list, stop, check, and remove
- Create organized technical documentation using Markdown

 Docker Commands Used

docker --version
docker info
docker pull nginx
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-nginx nginx
curl http://localhost:8080
docker ps
docker stop my-nginx
docker ps -a
docker rm my-nginx

 Skills Learned

- How to use Docker Command Line Interface
- Key differences between Virtual Machines and Containers
- How port mapping works between host and container
- Proper sequence of container lifecycle operations
- Writing clear technical documentation in Markdown

 Challenges Encountered

- Understanding how port mapping connects host and container ports
- Remembering the exact order and syntax of Docker commands
- Distinguishing between container images and running containers
